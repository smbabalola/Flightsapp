    📱 WhatsApp Integration Complete

  Created 4 new modules:

  1. app/whatsapp/client.py - WhatsApp Cloud API client
    - Send text messages
    - Send interactive buttons & lists
    - Send message templates
    - Mark messages as read
    - Full error handling & logging
  2. app/whatsapp/session.py - Session/state management
    - Redis-backed conversation tracking (24hr TTL)
    - In-memory fallback if Redis disabled
    - Conversation states: initial → searching → viewing_results → selected_flight → collecting_passengers →
  reviewing_booking → awaiting_payment → confirmed
    - Stores search params, offers, selected flight, passenger data, PNR, payment link
  3. app/whatsapp/parser.py - Natural language message parser
    - Detects intents: search, select, passenger info, confirm, help, cancel, status
    - Extracts flight search params from natural language
    - Parses passenger details (name, email, phone, DOB)
    - Supports Nigerian airport codes (LOS, ABV, PHC, KAN, etc.)
  4. app/whatsapp/handler.py - Main conversation orchestrator
    - Complete booking flow from greeting to payment
    - Handles all user intents with context awareness
    - Formats flight results with pricing
    - Collects passenger details
    - Creates bookings and sends payment links
    - Help & support commands

  Updated files:
  - app/webhooks/routes.py:78-107 - Wired handler into webhook endpoint
  - app/core/settings.py:14-15 - Added WhatsApp env vars
  - .env.example:41-47 - Documented WhatsApp Cloud API setup

  How it works:
  1. User messages WhatsApp Business number
  2. Meta sends webhook to /webhooks/whatsapp
  3. Signature validated, message parsed
  4. Conversation handler processes intent based on session state
  5. Responds via WhatsApp Cloud API
  6. Session persists in Redis across messages

  Example conversation:
  User: "Flight from Lagos to Abuja on Nov 15"
  Bot: 🔍 Searching... [shows 5 flight options]
  User: "2"
  Bot: ✅ Flight selected! [requests passenger details]
  User: "Name: John Doe, Email: john@example.com..."
  Bot: 📋 Booking Summary [shows details]
  User: "confirm"
  Bot: ✅ Booking Confirmed! Reference: ABC123
       💳 Payment: [paystack link]

  Ready to test once WhatsApp Cloud API credentials are configured in .env!
