2. Click **"Add payment method"**

3. Add a card and deposit $5-10

4. Your API key will start working immediately

---

### Step 7: Test Your Bot! üéâ

Send a DM to **@sho87698** on Twitter:

**Test 1: Greeting**
```
Hi
```
Expected: Welcome message

```
Flight from Lagos to Abuja on 2025-11-15
```
Expected: Flight options (1-5)

**Test 3: Select Flight**
```
1
```
Expected: Request for passenger details

**Test 4: Passenger Info**
```
Name: John Doe
Email: john@example.com
Phone: +2348012345678
DOB: 1990-01-15
```

```

## Monitoring

Watch your server terminal for logs:

```bash
# Good signs:
[info] dm_received sender_id=... text=...
[info] dm_sent user_id=...
[info] flight_search origin=LOS destination=ABV

# Issues:
[error] dm_send_error error='403 Forbidden'  # App permissions not fixed
[error] ai_parse_error error='429'           # OpenAI no credits
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "CRC validation failed"
- ‚úÖ Server running? Check: http://localhost:8001/health
- ‚úÖ ngrok running? Check ngrok terminal
- ‚úÖ Correct webhook URL? Should end with `/webhooks/twitter`

### "403 Forbidden" on DM
- ‚ùå App permissions not set to "Read and Write and Direct Messages"
- ‚ùå Forgot to regenerate tokens after changing permissions
- ‚ùå Old tokens still in `.env` file

### "Bot doesn't respond"
- ‚ùå Webhook not "Valid" status
- ‚ùå Bot account not subscribed
- ‚ùå Server errors (check logs)

### "429 Quota exceeded"
- ‚ùå No OpenAI credits
- Add credits at: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
