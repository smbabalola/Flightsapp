# Twitter API Access - Free Tier Limitations

## Your Current Plan: FREE
- 1 environment
- 100 Posts retrieval per month
- 500 writes per month
- v2 API access

## The Problem with DMs

**Account Activity API (webhooks for DMs)** is NOT available on the Free tier. It requires:
- **Basic tier** ($100/month) or higher
- OR the old Premium tier (being phased out)

## Your Options

### Option 1: Upgrade to Basic Tier ($100/month)
- Get Account Activity API (webhooks)
- Full DM support with real-time notifications
- Your bot works as designed

**Cost:** $100/month

### Option 2: Use Direct Message API v2 (Polling - Limited on Free Tier)
- Poll for new DMs every X minutes
- Limited to 100 requests per month on Free tier
- Not real-time, but works

**Cost:** FREE (but very limited)

### Option 3: Focus on Voice Integration (Twilio)
- Skip Twitter for now
- Use Twilio voice calls instead
- Costs based on usage (much cheaper)

**Cost:** Pay per call (~$0.01-0.05 per minute)

### Option 4: Use Twitter API v2 Mentions (Alternative)
- Users mention @sho87698 in tweets (not DMs)
- You can respond to mentions
- More public, but works on Free tier

**Cost:** FREE

### Option 5: Deploy Simple Web Interface
- Add a chat widget to your website
- Users book through web chat
- Use existing infrastructure

**Cost:** FREE

## Recommendation

Given your Free tier limitations, I recommend **one of these approaches**:

### Short-term (Testing):
Use **Option 4 - Twitter Mentions**:
- Users tweet: "@sho87698 I need a flight from Lagos to Abuja on Nov 15"
- Bot responds publicly with flight options
- User DMs payment details (or uses web form)
- Available on Free tier

### Medium-term (Production):
**Focus on Voice (Twilio)** or **Web Chat**:
- More reliable than Free tier Twitter
- Better user experience
- More scalable
- Lower cost

### Long-term (Scale):
If Twitter DMs are critical:
- Upgrade to Basic tier ($100/month)
- Get full webhook support
- Professional service

## What to Do Now

1. **Test Twitter Mentions** (works on Free tier)
2. **Get Twilio phone number** (when incorporated)
3. **Build web chat interface** (always works)

Would you like me to:
- A) Implement Twitter Mentions monitoring (works on your Free tier)
- B) Focus on getting Twilio voice working
- C) Build a simple web chat interface
- D) Show you how to upgrade to Basic tier
